//core features are the raw components that build up the foundation for the C++ program.
//(core feature)standard libraries are used to work on our programs very fast
//(core feature)STL is a part of CPP standard libraries but it is a collection of container types, algorithms and functions that work on these collections, we have specialized types called iterators that allow us to navigate through the containers potentially running these algorithms
// data types are int, double, float, char, bool, void, auto (keyword to deduce other types), etc.

//our programs are represented as 1s and 0s in program's RAM memory.

//for n digits, the data range is 0 to 2^n - 1 (in binary to be stored in the memory)

/* Data     Bytes     Data Range

//if we do not have enough bits on the left we can pad 0s to the places. This process is called padding.
